## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some
## benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than computing it repeatedly


## This function, `makeCacheMatrix` creates a special "matrix" object that can 
## cache its inverse, which is really a list containing a function to
## 1.  set the value of the matrix
## 2.  get the value of the matrix
## 3.  set the value of the inverse
## 4.  get the value of the inverse


makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        m <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                m <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setinverse <- function(inverse) m <<- inverse
        getinverse <- function() m
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setinverse = setinverse,
             getinverse = getinverse)
}




## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by
## makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated 
## (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve 
## the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {

        m <- x$getinverse()
        if(!is.null(m)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(m)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        m <- solv(data, ...)
        x$setinverse(m)
        m



        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
